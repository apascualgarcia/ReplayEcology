#  extract_subset.R
##########################################
# This function extracts for a given ASV
# table a subset of the table determined by a vector of
# factor levels present in a samples' metadata file.
# INPUT
#    ASV.table = A ASV table, with ASV in columns and samples in rows
#    sample.md = A df with samples' metadata
#    factor.vec = A char vector with the factors that should be
#        considered to extract the subset of samples
#    level.vec = A char vector with the level that should be
#        considered for each factor in factor.vec to
#        subset samples. Levels should be given in the
#        same order than factors (i.e. both vectors are paired).
#    sample.id = A string with the name of the column where the
#        names of the samples are found in the metadata table
# OUTPUT
#    A ASV table with the desired samples.
