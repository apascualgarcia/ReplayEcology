# This script performs an initial filtering of the sequence table down 
# to those samples that contain the names of communities used in this study. 
# It then filters out the least abundant ASVs 
# (to reduce number of ASVs/spurious ASVs), and removes samples with less 
# than 10K sequences, in line with our previous work.
